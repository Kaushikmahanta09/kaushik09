        "Ans: Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key idea behind inheritance is to establish a parent-child relationship, where the child class (also known as a derived class or subclass) inherits the characteristics of the parent class (also known as a base class or superclass). The child class can access and reuse the attributes and methods defined in the parent class without having to redefine them. It essentially allows for code reuse and promotes the concept of \"is-a\" relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance is used for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        " **Code Reusability:** **bold text** Inheritance enables the reuse of existing code by allowing the child class to inherit and extend the properties and behaviors of the parent class\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hierarchy and Organization:** Inheritance allows for the creation of class hierarchies, organizing related classes into logical structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Polymorphism:** Inheritance plays a crucial role in achieving polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Specialization and Generalization:** Inheritance supports the concept of specialization, where child classes can add specific attributes or behaviors to the inherited ones.\n",

        "**Code Organization and Maintenance:** Inheritance promotes a structured approach to organizing code, making it easier to manage and maintain."
